# Simple working SoccerNet configuration for improved detection performance
# Focus: Boost detection recall from 14.105% to 25-30%
# NOTE: Only using currently supported parameters

# Inherit from base configuration
defaults:
  - soccernet
  - _self_

# Override the jersey number detection module
modules:
  jersey_number_detect: improved_mmocr_simple

# Experiment configuration

use_wandb: false
use_rich: true

# Dataset configuration
dataset:
  vids_dict:
    valid: []  # Auto-select first available video

# Core pipeline modules
pipeline:
  - bbox_detector
  - reid
  - track
  - pitch
  - calibration
  - jersey_number_detect
  - tracklet_agg

# Optimized batch sizes for better quality
bbox_detector: {batch_size: 4}  # Reduced from 6 for better detection quality
pose_bottomup: {batch_size: 4}  # Reduced from 6 for better quality
reid: {batch_size: 32}  # Reduced from 48 for better quality
track: {batch_size: 32}  # Reduced from 48 for better quality
jersey_number_detect: {batch_size: 8}  # Optimized for jersey detection

# Detection optimization parameters
bbox_detector:
  conf_threshold: 0.25  # Lower confidence threshold for more detections
  iou_threshold: 0.45   # Optimized IoU threshold
