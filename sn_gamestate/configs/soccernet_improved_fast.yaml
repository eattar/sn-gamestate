# TrackLab SoccerNet config with Fast Improved Jersey Recognition

# The defaults list contains the files that will be used
# to create the final config file. This item *must* be
# the first element in the file.
# Detailed configs for each default component below are located in "sn-gamestate/sn-gamestate/configs" and "tracklab/tracklab/configs"
# Define here which implementation (yolov8, oc_sort, ..) to use for each generic (detection, tracking, ...) component.
defaults:
  - dataset: soccernet_gs
  - eval: gs_hota
  - engine: offline
  - visualization: gamestate  # Save tracking results as a .mp4 video in the run directory specified below (sn-gamestate/outputs/...)
  - modules/bbox_detector: yolo_ultralytics
  - modules/reid: prtreid
  - modules/track: bpbreid_strong_sort
  - modules/jersey_number_detect: improved_mmocr_fast  # Using fast improved jersey recognition
  - modules/team: kmeans_embeddings
  - modules/team_side: mean_position
  - modules/tracklet_agg: voting_role_jn  # Using baseline aggregation since improved module handles tracklet-level processing
  - modules/pitch : nbjw_calib
  - modules/calibration: nbjw_calib
  - _self_

# Pipeline definition :
# - Defines the order in which the modules will be called
# - If loading a tracking state from disk, remove modules whose outputs are already provided in the loaded state
# Use 'pipeline: []' for an empty pipeline (e.g. when loading all tracking results from a saved .pklz tracker state)
pipeline:
  - bbox_detector
  - reid
  - track
  - pitch
  - calibration
  - jersey_number_detect
  - tracklet_agg
  - team
  - team_side
