# ðŸš€ HYBRID JERSEY RECOGNITION: Optimized for >38% GS-HOTA
# Combines sequence-aware processing with baseline-tuned parameters

# Core processing parameters
batch_size: 16  # Optimized batch size for jersey detection
sequence_length: 7  # Longer sequences for better temporal aggregation
min_confidence_threshold: 0.15  # Lower threshold for maximum recall (like baseline)
min_sequence_confidence: 0.25  # Lower sequence confidence for more detections

# Temporal vs spatial weighting (optimized based on baseline success)
temporal_weight: 0.8  # Higher temporal weight for sequence consistency
spatial_weight: 0.2  # Lower spatial weight (baseline was spatial-focused)

# Confidence boosting (enabled for better performance)
use_confidence_boost: true
enable_aggressive_boosting: true

# Advanced features for maximum performance
# These parameters are supported by the ImprovedJerseyRecognition class
